# Definition of Terms



## 1. Canal  

An open channel conduit. Could be earth, masonry or concrete.  


## 2. Canal System

Canal system consists of canals and canal structures.  

### Various components:  

#### Main Canal   
The principal canal sourcing the water from the reservoir or diversion works down to the last lateral canal.

#### Lateral
Sources its water from the main canal and feeds to sub-laterals of main farm ditches.
        
#### Sublateral
Sources its water from the laterals and feeds to main farm ditches.
    
#### Main Farm Ditch (MFD)
Sources the water from main canal, laterals or sublaterals and feeds the supplementary farm ditches.

#### Supplementary Farm Ditch (SFD)
Sources the water from main farm ditches and supplies it directly to individual fields.

#### Conveyance Structures
Negotiates topographical and man-made features.

#### Conveyance System
Network of channels designed to convey water from the head regulator to the farms and is extended to the entire service area.
        
#### Protective Structures
Protects the irrigation system structures from storm water runoff of natual drains.
        
#### Regulatig Structures
Controls the water flow in the conveyance system.
        
#### Measurement Structures
Measures the rate of flow at different points in the canal system.


## 3. Surface Drains

Provided to avoid prolonged submergence of crops during rain or uncontrolled water inflow.

### 3.1. Drainage Channels

#### Field Drains or Farm Drains
Channels that drain out excess water from the fields.

#### Link Drains or Drainage Canals
Channels to convey water from field drains to natural drains.

#### Main Drains or Project Drains
Natural waterways of manmade channels draining water to the rivers.


## 4. Command Area

Area scoped by the canal system and can be classified into three types.

### Gross Command Area (GCA)

The geographical area that the water from the canal can flow by gravity.

### Culutable Command Area (CCA)

Land on which cultivation is possible.

### Service Area (Net CCA)

Culturable area less the the area covered by infrastructure roads, irrigation and drainage canals, etc.

To facilitate equitable water supply and timely water deliveries, the service area is divided into smaller, manageable units as stated below:

### Turnout Service Farm

Normally ranges from 30 has. to 50 has. depending on the constraint.

### Sub-Farms

Turnout service farms are further divided into smaller areas ranging from 8 has. to 12 has. and is catered by supplementary farm ditches.
