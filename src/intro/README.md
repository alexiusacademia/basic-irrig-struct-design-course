# Introduction

The main purpose of an irrigation system is to regulate and harness the water from natural resources and make use of it to use in crop lands. Harnessing water from the source can be made possible by constructing reservoirs, diversion dams or pumping systems (for groundwater or surface) and conveying it to the intended purpose (e.g. farmlands).

This course aims to use the science of hydrology and hydraulics engineering for the design and analysis of various irrigation and drainage structures. Imperical and derived fomulas will mostly be used in calculations for simplicity purposes. However, those that want to pursue the creation of computer programs at the end of the course may use numerical methods for iterative processes (approximations) instead.

This course will be fast paced but still can be easily understood and comprehend. Introduction of differential equations is eliminated so that no masters degree is necessary to easily understand the calculations.

This course consist of both lectures and workshops. The workshops may be given after each topic or group of topics. It is also advisable that most of the workshops be done in group. This will develop the participant's collaborative skills and this is also what is practiced in real life.
